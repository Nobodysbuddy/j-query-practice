# JQuery Importal

I am backedup on my HTML so I got up with JS. I was just lost so I came forward and downloaded backbone, JQuery and Underscore. I planned to start with JQuery and I created a new file, styled it up and added the js to it. I was stunned. As usual, the thing didn't work well first, but I understood why it didn't work.### My JS compiler was disabled! I activated it and moved forward to the bigger part.

#Had I Done It?

< I had done it! Hurray! it was working with full strength. I was delighted.
